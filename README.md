- 👋 Hi, I’m Cameron Kruger ([cameronkruger.me](https://www.cameronkruger.me))
- 👀 I’m interested in back end Go & Python development, and am digging into Rust, Solidity & Web3 in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CS @ George Mason University (class of '22!).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller open source projects, and maybe join a dev team for a DeFi project or DAO.
